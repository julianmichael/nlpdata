# nlpdata

Utilities for reading and working with various datasets for NLP.

Documentation coming soon. Any documentation lying around the codebase is out of date.

Releases are not set up yet. This will either be released using Maven Central or Jitpack... but getting these to work has been confusing. For now, just include it as a subproject in SBT using the git URL as a ProjectRef.
